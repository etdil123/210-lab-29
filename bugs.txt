Reporting bugs below:
1. One bug is that the output is only displaying the first team in the dataset - not all 25 
- Correction: My team names data in the txt file had two words - changed to just one word for the team name

2. When displaying the games being played, my for loop was showing game 6 as the first game played
- Correction: Needed to adjust the for loop to begin at 4 instead of 5

3. When displaying season table the output was not displaying correctly
- Correction: I needed to include an endl after each iteration of the loop displaying data

4. Couldn't display the end of season scores ranking teams by total number of points
- Correction: Couldn't figure out how to rank by points. Instead I added a function to determine winner of the entire league by most points scored.

5. Each time I ran a simulation the simulation statistics would be the same and the winner would be the same each time.
- Correction: I needed to seed with srand(time(0)) so each time the randomness of the simulation would produce different outputs

6. Peformance factor was not factoring in correctly and the totals were too much
- Correction: changed the total points calculation to teamPoints * (1 + bonus) and fixed the issue

7. When inputting the map into the function kept running into an error
- Correction: had to change the parameter input to map<string, array<list<int>, 3> > &teamStats

8. When calculating the averages I wasn't able to get the decimal points to display to the user
- Correction: Needed to use static_cast<float> to see floating point values
