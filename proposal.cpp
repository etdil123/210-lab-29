// Define main function
    // Initialize a map used to store team information - each team will have array of lists for points, rebounds, assists

    // Open external file to read data on first 5 games of the season 
        // print error and exit if file doesn't open
    
    // read data from external file and use to populate the map
        // Store the initial team names into the map
        // for each line - get the stats from the file
            // put the stats into the proper list for the team

    // close file
