// include necessary headers related to data structures

// Definition for function to simulate a game for a team 
    // parameters: map of team and list to update stats
    // creates a variable to randomly assign how the team is going to play
    // randomly create stats for points, rebounds, assists - add to the lists

// Define main function
    // Initialize a map used to store team information - each team will have array of lists for points, rebounds, assists

    // Open external file to read data on first 5 games of the season 
        // print error and exit if file doesn't open
    
    // read data from external file and use to populate the map
        // Store the initial team names into the map
        // for each line - get the stats from the file
            // put the stats into the proper list for the team

    // close file

    // Time based simulation of the 25 game season
        // For a loop of 25 times
            // Go through each team on map 
                // call the function to input stats for one game for the team
                // print each teams performance in the game

    // rank and display the teams at the end of the season to show season performance

    // end the main function
