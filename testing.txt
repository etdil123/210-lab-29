Unit Testing

For this program, I would use unit testing to test the function that simulates the games
and stores the corresponding data into that teams map and list 
- the unit test would make sure that the data is stored for the right team
- unit teast would make sure the randomization of numbers for stats is also correct
- there would be an output statement to display that the correct data is showing - the function returns void so it's important that the output statment is included
